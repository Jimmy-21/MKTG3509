## *Table of Contents*
1. ***Module 2: Programming Fundamentals***
   - [A2 - The Basics of Programming](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KvWE6CdmgMcOAorS1X8RJ3R_9BuivLjt?usp=sharing)
      - In this assignment we had to test our initial knowledge of coding by working with lists, functions, if loops, etc.
2. ***Module 3: Working with Data***
   - [A3 - Real World Yelp Reviews](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IzqoBYwgGRpmUFJ5LR5YGdjfFMopK9Y5?usp=sharing)
      - In this assignment we worked with real world Yelp reviews in which we analyzed the usefulness of the reviews for a business. We both merged data and used groupby statements to get our answers.
3. ***Module 4: Data Visualization***
   - [A4 - Runway Data + Telecommunications Service Data](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Jtee7i0VV_GVPHMHR7MG7WygF-7SlyUw?usp=sharing)
      - In this assignment we looked at 2 datasets. In the runway dataset we looked at what categories of clothing seemed to fit best through bar graphs. In the Telecommunications Data we looked at how likley somone is willing to churn their service by comparing statistics such as their Average Rate, Total minutes and Total calls by using scatterplots.
4. ***Module 6: Regression***
   - [A6 - Regression Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CCSL48zdQDioUCPouJvSPdsc8Dgbiazw?usp=sharing)
      - In this assignment we created a regression analysis of two different sets of data to see if we understood how to interpret a regression analysis.
5. ***Module 8: Discrete Outcomes and Logit***
   - [A8 - Logit](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_GyXvO-qkwQBsvikIL21NpmtQ_Ubkf8N?usp=sharing)
      - In this assignment we go through logit in python and the usefulness of calculating the marginal effects of sets of data.
6. ***Module 9: Clustering and segmentation***
   - [A9 - Segmentation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1930t3ARXWLQTs6dZmhpHEo7BHxhn9vcF?usp=sharing)
      - In this assignment we determined the optimal number of segments that could be used to interpret a dataset and created a K means clustering.
7. ***Module 10: Text Analysis***
    - [A10 - Vegas Resorts Text Mining](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tz98EZxGKKkVY6oy5lE5FWYqi5Sr7kuQ?usp=sharing)
        - In this module we interpreted the validity/meaning of real world hotel reviews through Text Analysis. We measuerd the subjectivity and polarity of the reviews. We also looked at the common keywords or recurring topics that showed up for each review through TF-IDF and LDA models.
